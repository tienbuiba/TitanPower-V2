    Passive Components
    Passive electronic components are found in an electrical or computer system and require no electrical current to operate; in other words, they are incapable of power gain. Some of these components include resistors, capacitors, inductors, surge protectors, and more. Various types of electronic devices require passive components in order to work. Resistors are often found in fuses, sensors, heaters, and lighting. Other household items such as computers, cameras, game consoles, cellphones, and television also require passive components in order to function.`
